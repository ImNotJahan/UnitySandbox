A parasitic worm that slowly sucks your blood and causes time to speed up and slow down at random. It can easily be pulled off but most of its body will be ripped apart when being ripped off which can cause slight dammage to the skin. Its teeth also work very well as needles if you manage to get some unshattered ones.
